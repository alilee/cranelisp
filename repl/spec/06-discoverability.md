## 6. Discoverability [Tested]

### 6.1 First Five Minutes [Tested tests/repl_lifecycle::first_session_journey_launch_to_confidence]

A new user opening the REPL with no prior knowledge MUST be able to:

1. See that `/help` is available (mentioned in the startup banner or prompt)
2. Evaluate a simple expression and see a typed result: `(+ 1 2)` → `:primitives/Int 3`
3. Define a function and see its inferred type: `(defn id [x] x)` → `:(Fn [a] a) user/id`
4. Find available operators and functions via `/list`
5. Get help on any symbol via `/info` or `/sig`

### 6.2 Startup Banner [Tested tests/repl_lifecycle::boot_shows_banner]

The REPL MUST display a startup banner including:
- The language name and version
- A hint about `/help`

The banner SHOULD be concise (3 lines or fewer).

### 6.3 First Session Journey [Tested tests/repl_lifecycle::first_session_journey_launch_to_confidence]

The "first five minutes" (§6.1) lists capabilities. This section scripts the **narrative arc** — the sequence a new user follows from launch to confidence. Each step builds on the previous one; nothing requires prior knowledge. This journey defines the `first-session.demo` showcase script.

**Phase 1: Orientation** (banner → `/help`)

The user launches cranelisp and sees a banner with the language name and a `/help` hint. They type `/help`. The output shows them slash commands exist, organized by purpose. They now know there is a self-documentation system. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 2: First evaluation** (expression → typed result)

The user types a simple expression. The result shows `:Type value` format — they learn that the REPL always shows types. They try a few more: booleans, arithmetic. Each result reinforces the `:Type value` pattern. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 3: Defining things** (defn → type inference)

The user defines a function. The REPL shows the inferred type scheme and qualified name. They call it. They see that the REPL inferred the types without annotation. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 4: Introspection** (`/sig`, `/list`, `/info`)

The user wants to see what they've defined. `/list` shows their definitions. `/imports` shows what's available from elsewhere (including special forms). `/sig` shows a function's type. `/info` shows full details. They discover that the REPL knows about everything and can explain it. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 5: Making mistakes** (error → recovery)

The user makes a type error. The error message names the expected and actual types. They continue typing — the session is intact. They learn the REPL is resilient. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 6: Self-documentation** (bare symbols, special forms)

The user types a function name bare. The REPL shows its type. They type `if` bare. It shows the special form's shape. They learn that any name typed bare produces documentation, not an error. *(Ring 0)*

**Phase 7: Richer types** (strings, ADTs, Vecs)

The user creates a string, defines an ADT, pattern-matches on it. They create a Vec. Each value displays in a readable format that mirrors the language syntax. *(Ring 1)*

**Phase 8: Composition** (closures, higher-order, putting it together)

The user combines what they've learned: a closure over an ADT, applied via a higher-order function, stored in a Vec. The REPL handles it all. They feel confident. *(Ring 1)*

Later rings extend this journey with modules (`/mod`), traits, macros (`/expand`), and IO, but the core loop — evaluate, inspect, make mistakes, recover — is established by Ring 1.

### 6.4 Tab Completion [R4 S11]

The REPL SHOULD support tab completion for:
- Symbol names (functions, types, constructors)
- Slash commands
- Module names (after `/mod`)

This is a SHOULD, not a MUST, because it depends on the terminal library.
